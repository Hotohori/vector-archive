# The Vector Archive
This repo is intended to house archives for the Anki Vector (n√©e Victor) robot.

# Useful addresses hardcoded in to the Vector app & OS
* Accounts API: https://accounts.api.anki.com/1/sessions
* Locations API: https://locations.api.anki.com/1/locations
* OTA Updates delivered from: http://ota.global.anki-services.com/vic/prod/full/latest.ota

# Vector SDK Registration Flow
* Self-signed cert downloaded from Vector
* User session established with Anki using the Accounts API
* Session token Base64 encoded
* Machine hostname Base64 encoded
* Encoded session token & machine hostname sent to Vector API (/v1/user_authentication)
* Vector responds with Base64 encoded OAuth token (client_token_guid)
* guid decoded and stored in the sdk_config.ini

# Vector API Usage
* Nearly all calls to Vector are POSTS
* /v1/user_authentication is the only request that doesn't require a bearer token

# Currently known Vector API Endpoints
